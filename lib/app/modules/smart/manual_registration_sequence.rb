        # Background

        Apps need to be registered with the authorization service in order to be launched.  The registration process provides
        the client app with a `client_id` which identifies the client.  A `client_secret` may also be issued if the app is
        designated a confidential app that can satisfactorily protect the secret.  The app provides the authorization service:

         * zero or more launch URLs
         * one or more redirect URLs

        A launch URLs are used for executing an EHR launch, but are unnecessary for a Standalone launch.

        # Test Methodology

        This test sets the `client_id` to be used by Inferno.

        For more information see:

        * [Registering a SMART App with an EHR](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/#registering-a-smart-app-with-an-ehr)

              )

      test 'User entered client id, and client secret if confidential client' do
        metadata do
          id '01'

          desc %(
            Received client id (and client secret if necessary)
          )
        end
